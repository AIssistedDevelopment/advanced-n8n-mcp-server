## Credential Management Strategy (n8n Community Edition)

## Overview
n8n Community Edition does **not** support listing credentials via the public API. This means that automation tools (like Claude Desktop via MCP) cannot discover or assign credentials programmatically unless the credential ID is already known.

## Solution: Credential Mapping and Types Files
To enable full workflow automation, place the server, Electron app (.exe), `credentials-map.json`, and `credential-types.json` all in the same folder. Both the app and the server will always read/write these files in their current working directory, so all must be together for correct operation.

### Example `credentials-map.json`
```json
{
  "openAiApi": { "id": "123", "name": "OpenAI API Key" },
  "githubApi": { "id": "456", "name": "GitHub Token" }
}
```

### Example `credential-types.json`
```json
{
  "types": ["openAiApi", "githubApi", ...],
  "typeStates": { "openAiApi": true, "githubApi": false, ... }
}
```

- **credentials-map.json**: Only contains actual credential mappings (type ‚Üí {id, name}).
- **credential-types.json**: Contains the master list of credential types and their enabled/disabled state for the UI.

## How to Add a New Credential
1. **Create the credential in n8n** (UI > Credentials > New credential).
2. **Get the credential ID** from the URL or details panel in the n8n UI.
3. **Update `credentials-map.json`** (in the same folder as the app/server) with the new type, ID, and name.
4. **Reload the MCP server** if needed.

## Security Considerations
- The mapping file contains only IDs and names‚Äî**never secrets or API keys**.
- Keep the mapping file private if you want to avoid leaking integration names.

## Limitations
- If you delete or recreate a credential in n8n, you must update the mapping file.
- No automation is possible for credential discovery in Community Edition; this is a manual step.

## Automation Workflow
- Claude Desktop (via MCP) requests a credential of a certain type.
- The MCP server looks up the type in the mapping file and assigns the correct ID to the node.
- n8n uses the ID to fetch the real secret at runtime.

## Future Improvements
- If n8n adds credential listing to the API, this process can be automated.
- For now, this mapping/types file approach is the most secure and reliable for Community Edition.

# Credential Mapping Helper System

## Overview
To make updating the credential mapping file easy and error-free, use the provided local server and browser bookmarklet:

### 1. Credential Mapping Server
- The server listens on `http://localhost:32192/map` and updates the `credentials-map.json` file in the same folder.

### 2. Browser Bookmarklet
- Add the provided JavaScript as a bookmark in your browser.
- When viewing a credential in n8n, click the bookmarklet.
- The bookmarklet sends the ID and name to the local server and shows a notification on success. The app will prompt you to select a type.

### 3. Security
- The mapping file contains only IDs and names, not secrets.
- The local server only listens on localhost and should not be exposed to the internet.

### 4. Troubleshooting
- If the bookmarklet fails, check that the local server is running and accessible.
- Make sure your browser allows notifications and fetch requests to `localhost`.
- If the credential name or ID is not detected, enter them manually when prompted.

### 5. Updating the Mapping
- After adding a new credential in n8n, use the bookmarklet to update the mapping file in seconds‚Äîno manual JSON editing required.

# Credential Mapping GUI (Electron App)

## Overview
This project includes a simple Electron-based desktop app for managing the `credentials-map.json` and `credential-types.json` files used by the MCP server. The app is designed for use **only within this repository** and is not intended as a general-purpose credential manager. It is tightly integrated with the MCP workflow and always reads/writes the mapping and types files in the same folder as the app/server.

## Features
- View, add, edit, and delete credential mappings (type, ID, name)
- Manage the master list of credential types and their enabled/disabled state
- Status indicator and manual start/stop controls
- Integrates with the browser bookmarklet for easy credential capture from n8n

## Folder Structure
- `src/credential-mapping-app/` ‚Äî Electron app source code
- `credentials-map.json` ‚Äî The mapping file managed by the app. **It must be in the same folder as the app/server.**
- `credential-types.json` ‚Äî The types file managed by the app. **It must be in the same folder as the app/server.**

## Usage
1. Start the app from the MCP repo root: `npm run credential-mapping-app` (or use the provided desktop shortcut)
2. Use the GUI to view or edit mappings, or start the mapping server
3. Use the settings dialog to manage credential types and their enabled/disabled state
4. The server will auto-shutdown after a bookmarklet POST, or you can shut it down manually

## Security
- The mapping and types files are only modified when the app is running
- No background processes unless explicitly started

See the technical guide for more details on integration and workflow.

#### Mapping Fields
- **Type**: The credential type string as used in n8n (e.g., `n8n-api` or `googleSheetsApi`). This is how the MCP knows which credential to assign to which node type.
- **ID**: The unique credential ID in n8n. This is what n8n uses internally to reference the credential.
- **Name**: The human-readable name of the credential in n8n. This is for clarity and UI display, and helps agents or users distinguish between multiple credentials of the same type.

#### Types File Fields
- **types**: Array of all known credential types (default and custom)
- **typeStates**: Object mapping type name to enabled/disabled state

![Credential Mapping Manager screenshot](./docs/credential-mapping-manager.png)

## Usage

- Start the app. The server can be started/stopped from the main window.
- The credential mapping table is scrollable. Use the **refresh** (‚ü≥) and **settings** (‚öô) icons at the top right to update or configure credential types.
- To add a mapping from your browser, use the **Script** button in the bottom right corner to copy the bookmarklet. Paste it into your browser bookmarks bar. When you need to send a credential, click the bookmarklet while viewing a credential in n8n. The app will prompt you to select a credential type from your enabled types list, then save the mapping and auto-refresh.
- Only enabled types (managed in settings) appear in the selection dialog. Default types are toggleable (enable/disable) but not deletable; custom types are both toggleable and deletable. There is no add new type button on the main page‚Äîtypes are managed only in the settings dialog.
- The **Script** button is small and unobtrusive, always available in the bottom right of the app window.
- All mappings are saved to `credentials-map.json` and all types to `credential-types.json` in the app/server directory.

## For AI Agents and MCP Integrations
- Only use `credentials-map.json` for credential mappings (type ‚Üí {id, name}).
- Ignore `credential-types.json` unless you are managing the UI or type list.
- Do not treat any keys in `credentials-map.json` as types or states‚Äîonly as mappings.
